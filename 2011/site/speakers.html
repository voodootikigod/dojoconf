                   - AMD module patterns
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Much of the hype about AMD modules centers around performance and code size (and it's well-deserved).  But modules are as important to software architecture as dojo.declare()!
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this session, we'll take a look at some classic, general-purpose patterns re-spun as AMD modules as well as a few advanced, implementation-specific patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Specifically, we'll cover:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Singletons, Decorators, Adapters</li>
                  <li>Inversion of Control / Dependency Injection</li>
                  <li>Mediators and inter-module coordination</li>
                  <li>Model-View-Controller patterns</li>
                  <li>Self-contained Widgets (js, css, and html)</li>
                  <li>Strategies for sharing code on the server</li>

                   - DataGrid Bootcamp: Extreme Performance Hacks for Big Data
                </h4>
                <p>
                  We love the <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/dojox/grid/DataGrid.html">Dojox DataGrid</a>. It has built-in pagination, dynamic data binding, flexible resizing, and all kinds of <em>sexy</em> customization options. However, when you operate in the world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">Big Data</a>, it can fall short of its promise, ballooning your memory footprint, crushing your JavaScript engine, and otherwise causing your users to <strong>curse your name</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm going to walk through the lessons we've learned over the past 2+ years about how to use DataGrid to render extremely wide, extremely large data sets without thrashing your browser (or your users' will to live).

                <p>
                  Let's face it, not everyone has the same abilities.  Folks with vision or mobility impairments want to use Web applications, too!  The core widget set of Dojo is fully accessible to people who rely on the keyboard or assistive technologies like a screen reader to interact with the Web.  Your mission is to  learn how to make your Dojo apps accessible.  Your assigned agent will  decode the mysteries of ARIA  and will demo a fully accessible Dojo app!  Accept the challenge to make the Web inclusive for all!

                   - Dojo Web Builder - Building Dojo in the Cloud
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Dojo's build system has long been one of the the toolkit's greatest, but least understood, features. Using the build system properly dramatically improves the performance of your application!
                </p>
                <p>
                  However.... Fiddling about with shell scripts?  Needing to download the full source distribution?  Understanding long READMEs and cryptic profile files?  Manually categorising your application dependencies?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pffft, not any more! Using the newly launched Dojo Web Builder you can ignore all of the above and just your web browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using the Web Builder you can easily search through the database of all Dojo modules, selecting those required, including themes, configuring optimisers and much more. The Web Builder compiles your custom Dojo version remotely and just returns you the result.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More importantly, the auto-analysis feature lets you make the Web Builder do the hard work for you. Point it at your unoptimised Dojo application and it'll generate a custom build having analysed your application's dependencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, the project's now open source as an official Dojo Foundation project. Running the tool locally allows you to expose your own application's module through the Web Builder or build older versions of Dojo.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This talk will walk through using the tool's features, demonstrating common use cases and talking about the future plans to make it even simpler to generate Dojo builds.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  The purpose of this presentation is to illustrate how the dojo graphic API (gfx) can be leveraged to build advanced features needed by rich graphical application. In particular, we will demontrate how to build gfx extensions enabling advanced symbology : a layout mechanism to arrange shapes automatically and dynamically, a simple templating engine and gfx data binding. These extensions will be demonstrated in action taking as an example a diagramming web application.

                   - The Art of Developing Nano Widgets
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Dojo's flagship widget system, dijit, is packed full of features and packed full of bytes that result in longer download, parse, and execution times. Sometimes you just need a lightweight widget that doesn't have all the extra stuff dijit provides.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This talk describes the basic principals for designing non-dijit widgets that are small and fast containing only the functionality you need.  We'll take dijit widgets such as the AccordionContainer, then hack it down to a fraction of the functionality and size.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  "Machiavellian" is usually pejorative, a term laced with disdain and subtle contempt. However, to actually read Machiavelli is to study applied Realism in the context of meeting goals. As a community, we (Dojo) have certain goals; how can we reach them effectively? How can we best position ourselves in the toolkit/library ecosystem in order to reach our goals? How can we survive in a world more and more infatuated with tiny individual libraries, when the perception is that Dojo is heavy? Machiavelli provides us with keen insights into human nature—insights that still serve us well nearly 500 years later.

                   - What's broke with Rails, Django, and every other web app framework...and how to fix them
                </h4>
                <p>
                  "[Rails] has become the framework of choice for implementation [...] of Web 2.0 applications" --Agile Web Development with Rails <i>2006</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Really? Then why isn't everybody using Rails in 2011? Did something else replace it? Yes. The 100 other frameworks that were around before it, or came after it, and make the same claims. Isn't it obvious with so many competing frameworks that <b>none of them are solving the problem</b>?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our mental model of a web app is clearly broke. But there is hope: the Javascript community with recent advances in powerful client-side toolkits like Dojo have provided the necessary missing pieces to compose a new design for web apps that can provide an order of magnitude reduction in complexity--resulting in the ability to write better applications, faster, at less cost.
                </p>

                   - Mustache? I'll raise you an Eyebrow! — Reactive Templates and Widgets with Eyebrow templates
                </h4>
                <p>
                  At <a href="http://state.it">State</a> we're building a platform and website for people to share opinions. We've developed a new template system named Eyebrow, based on Mustache and DTL. It has template inheritance, filters, template variables custom tags and if/else logic. It's also DOM-aware. In Node, we parse the template syntax and run the markup through JSDOM. This gives us an AST for both template tags and the DOM nodes. We can use this to compile a Node module for server-side rendering and a JSON definition for the browser runtime. In the browser, this gives us reactive templates where model changes are automatically reflected in the DOM, down to the text node level.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eyebrow also manages our Dojo widgets, taking care of attaching events and maintaining attach points. This leads to a new and interesting approach for writing Dojo widgets. They can become much more like controllers: handling DOM events, implementing application logic and updating a model. The view will automatically reflect the changes. Here's an example of a widget that automatically renders what you type into an `&lt;input>` field:
                </p>
                <p>

                   - Web apps on the BlackBerry PlayBook
                </h4>
                <p>
                  This session will provide you with an in-depth account of building a mobile web game for the  BlackBerry PlayBook using the WebKit web  browser and the BlackBerry Webworks platform. I will recount the lessons learnt while developing such an app, why mobile is truly different and how you can adapt your desktop Dojo skills for the job at hand. I will lay down a few best practices that are emerging, and then cap it all with a description of how you can submit your own app on BlackBerry AppWorld.

                   - Frameworks.next: How Faster Browser Evolution Will Change How We Think
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Dojo provides a stable, dependable, best-you-can-get solution for designers and developers who want flexibility, performance, reach, and fewer headaches down the road. Mobile is starting to challenge some of the assumptions that makes it possible for to deliver these attributes in a single codebase, and new frameworks are emerging to fill the gaps created by new constraints -- better standards support on average, different network latencies, different form factors, etc.

                <p>
                  This talk explores how language, platform, and market evolution will change the dynamic further and faster, allowing the Dojo community to consider new approaches...if we can muster the will to get out in front of it.
