                <p>lifeIMAGE provides medical image and information exchange apps that hospitals, physicians and patients can use to access and share imaging records, anywhere. Our services have been rapidly adopted by the nation's leading hospitals and are being used globally to improve clinical collaboration and patient care. IifeIMAGE was named one of the year’s most innovative technologies by The Wall Street Journal as part of its international 2010 Technology Innovation Awards.</p>
                <p>We’re rebuilding our JavaScript-based UI platform from the ground up.  At its heart it’s dojo, but not the dojo you’re probably used to. Live data flows through our apps and across the globe in real-time, driven by Comet, Promises, and two-way data binding using dojo’s new JsonRest, Observable, and Stateful objects.</p>
                <p>We’re 100% AMD modules, baby!  No global variables here.  Add some MVC, IOC, and AOP and you can understand why we’re excited to be front-end engineers at lifeIMAGE.</p>

Wanna help us revolutionize healthcare IT?  <a href="http://www.lifeimage.com/about-us/careers">We are expanding our team!  lifeIMAGE is looking for brilliant JavaScript minds and "start-up personalities" who want to be part of changing healthcare IT, not just for physicians, but for the average person and patient.</a></p>
